# IDX Project for NextJS learn/dashboard-app

When you need an environment to start coding but all you've got is a microwave with a display and an internet connection.
Or you are just lazy and don't want to set up everything on your machine.

## Steps to start:

1. Go to [Project IDX](https://idx.google.com/import) (import section).
2. Paste this link 'https://github.com/giacomofm/idx-nextjs-learn-dashboard-app' (or your fork of it).
3. Wait for your environment to start.
4. In the meantime, start reading [Chapter 1 of the NextJS getting started course](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/getting-started).
5. Your environment now should be ready.
6. Do a hard restart on the preview and start learning by coding!

Have fun coding!
