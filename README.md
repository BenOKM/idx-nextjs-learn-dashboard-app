# IDX Project for NextJS learn/dashboard-app

When you need an environment to start coding but all you have is a microwave with a display and an internet connection.
Or you're just too lazy to set up everything on your machine.

## Steps to start:

1. Go to [Project IDX](https://idx.google.com/import) (import section).
1. Paste this link: "https://github.com/giacomofm/idx-nextjs-learn-dashboard-app" (or your fork of it).
1. Wait for your environment to start.
1. In the meantime, start reading the [Introduction and Chapter 1 of the NextJS Getting Started course](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app). The script in the `.idx/onCreate.sh` file will basically follow all the steps of Chapter 1 for you.
1. Your environment should now be ready.
1. You can now do an hard restart on the web preview and start learning by coding!

Have fun coding!
